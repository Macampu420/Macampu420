🔥 About Me

If you’re here looking for my “best code,” you probably won’t find it. The most solid and refined code I’ve written is running in production, powering private and corporate platforms at scale.

However, if you’re curious about what I’m working on, you’ll find some personal projects, experiments, and small tools here.

🛠️ Technologies I Work With • Frontend: TypeScript, React, HTML, CSS, UX/UI • Backend: Node.js, Python, SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL), MongoDB • Tools: Git/GitHub, Docker, Microservices

🎯 Key Experience • Developed and scaled a web app with 10,000+ active users and a database with 50,000+ records. • Built an administration panel that improved content management and operational efficiency. • Designed and implemented tech solutions to optimize procurement workflows in the public sector.
